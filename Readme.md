# Emotion Recognition Using Speech

This Project aims to identify the emotion of a person from the recorded speech sample. This will be done with the help of a Neural Network which will be created and run locally. This is a final year project for Bachelor's in Computer Engineering for University of Mumbai.

## Prerequisites

* Data Sets:

1. RAVDESS : You can read about it by following the link : <https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.XfxCL0czZPY>
2. SAVEE : You can read about it by following the link : <http://kahlan.eps.surrey.ac.uk/savee/>

* Software/Technologies used :

1. Python 3 : Specfically Python 3.6x as Python 3.7 and above have some complications with tensorflow.
2. Tensorflow : Machine Learning Library, we are using the GPU variant here to make things a tad bit faster.
3. Anaconda : We are using Anaconda Environment for the ease of setting things up and keeping them updated. Also some conda custom libraries are faster than usual python stock libraries hence optimisation helps in speed.
4. Keras : A Machine Learning Library based on Tensorflow
5. Some other things : Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, etc.
